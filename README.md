# fractals
Started as my attempt at visualizing the mandelbrot set, now revisiting the repo and working on some more fractals.

EDIT: dont trust donkeys

I lied, though I did add burning ship, working with numba was eventually not sufficient for me and it became tedious as i wanted the drawing function to be generic (to recieve other fractals) but that came at a cost of making numba fallback from nopython mode (rightfully so) and it became slow so eventually I just got tired of it to the point of deciding to continue my journeys [here](https://github.com/dankeyy/fractals2). sorry

if you aren't me & reading this & have an idea that's not `use pypy` (not that it's a bad suggestion), pr/dm me
